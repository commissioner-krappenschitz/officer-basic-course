# Introduction to Pursuits

## What is a Pursuit?

When in the officers' judgement, an individual is fleeing from law enforcement and failing to yield to emergency signals an officer may call pursuit (10-80) on the radio

* Per our penal code, there are 2 charges that warrants a 10-80 (vehicle pursuit) being called;
  * 1\. Evading an Officer- “When a subject flees from a police officer in a vehicle to avoid being apprehended, detained, or arrested.”
  * 2\. Reckless Evading- “A subject dangerously flees from a police officer in a vehicle to avoid being apprehended, detained or arrested in a way which shows blatant disregard for life or property.”
    * Note- Reckless Evading implies Evading. These are not to be stacked in an arrest.
* If in your judgement one of the above conditions are met, call 10-80 on the radio (do not immediately assume someone is running because they don't stop as soon as turn on your emergency signals on)

## What do I do in a pursuit?

* **GIVE YOUR POSITION** - You do not want to be alone dealing with a felon by yourself, and if you call pursuit everyone in the local area will be attempting to get to your location. Constantly update your street/postal as you can, and direction of travel.
  * Use cardinal compass directions; north, east, south, and west.
* **DESCRIBE WHAT YOU’RE CHASING** - If the vehicle you’re chasing escapes, the patrol needs to know what they’re looking for. Try to give vehicle make/model, color(s), number of occupants, and license plate if you have it.
* **KEEP YOUR DISTANCE** - This rule applies not only to the vehicle being pursued, but for other units as well. You should be no closer than about 4 car lengths from any participant in the pursuit. The faster you move, the longer it takes you to stop.
* In a pursuit, the lead car pursues, the secondary unit makes radio for the pursuit
* Additional units in the pursuit provide relief as needed (i.e refueling, replacing units breaking off due to damage of vehicle, etc)
* The last vehicle, if needed, will traffic break. Traffic breaking is simply occupying lanes by driving left and right to ensure no civilian traffic passes the pursuit.

## When can I join a pursuit?

As a general rule of thumb, there should not be more than 4 units on a pursuit. If there are 4 units on a pursuit, do not request to attach or self attach unless a supervisor has requested more.

* Any supervisor from any department may terminate a pursuit
* Individual officers reserve the right to terminate their own pursuit at their discretion. If you feel unsafe chasing, then don't.
