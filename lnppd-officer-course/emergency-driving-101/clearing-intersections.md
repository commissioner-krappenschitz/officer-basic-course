# Clearing Intersections

* When approaching an intersection, slow the vehicle to a speed where you can stop if needed and ensure the intersection is safe to proceed through
* Although they should, DO NOT expect a motorist with a green light to come to a stop for you when entering an intersection and you have lights and sirens on.
