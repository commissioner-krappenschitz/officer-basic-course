# Making an Arrest

{% hint style="info" %}
**Arresting**

* When you have decided you will make an arrest, approach them from behind and apply handcuffs through your F6 menu
* After placing handcuffs on the individual, do a thorough search of their person, and investigate articles found
  * i.e- _`“/me search’s Bobby Jackson, wdif?”`_
* If you find a wallet, search the wallet and contents
* If you find a firearm, look for a serial number and ensure it’s registered to them via CAD. Ensure they have a valid weapons permit.
* Search and investigate everything on their person

**Questioning**

* After you have arrested a subject, and before interviewing them- read the person their Miranda rights:

_“You have the right to remain silent, anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney, if you cannot afford an attorney one will be provided for you by the state. Do you understand these rights as they’ve been read to you?”_



* <mark style="color:red;">**Note**</mark> - this is a requirement before any interview regarding the criminals own actions while committing a crime is performed. Failure to inform an individual of their 5th amendment rights prior to interview could result in anything being said after the arrest and before reading Miranda rights getting thrown out in a case, and ultimately losing a conviction _(Miranda v. Arizona Feb 1966)_



* You <mark style="color:red;">**should**</mark> always read someone their rights prior to questioning.
* You <mark style="color:red;">**are not required**</mark> to read Miranda rights if you do not intend to interview them.
