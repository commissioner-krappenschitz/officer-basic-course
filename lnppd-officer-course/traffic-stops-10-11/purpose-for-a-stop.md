{% hint style="info" %}
Note - When you have a driver stopped on a traffic stop, the driver and all the occupants in the vehicle, are detained. They may not leave until you dismiss them. You may order individuals out of a vehicle if you feel it necessary, to include the passengers. There is no legal requirement to provide someone a supervisor at their request. You should only request a supervisor if you are unsure about a procedure.
