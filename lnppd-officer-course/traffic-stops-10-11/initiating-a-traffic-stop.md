# Initiating a Traffic Stop

* Pull behind the vehicle to be stopped and activate emergency signals
* If you do not see any suitable place to conduct the stop, donâ€™t hesitate to wait a moment for the subject to continue up the road- or even use your PA system to tell the driver to pull further down the road.
* Once the target vehicle is stopped position your car vehicle 2-3 car lengths away from the vehicle, and just like with accident scenes, angle your vehicle to provide yourself protection from other vehicles.
