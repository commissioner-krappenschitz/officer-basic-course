# Decide your action

* If you decide and arrest will be made, attempt to have a second officer on scene with you
* If you will write a ticket/warning file through CAD and then return to the driver informing them that they will be receiving a citation

#### Issuing Citations/Warnings

* Utilize your CAD and issue the citation/warning inside of CAD and ensure it is properly processed.
* Return to the driver and return their documents to them- DO NOT forget to return their items to them.
