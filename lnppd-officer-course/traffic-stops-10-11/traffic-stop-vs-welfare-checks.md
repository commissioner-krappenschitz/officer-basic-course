# Traffic Stop vs Welfare Checks

Every time you stop behind a motor vehicle with your lights on, does not mean you are detaining the individual(s) involved on a traffic stop

Example - You see a motorist stopped on the side of the road and stop behind them to check on them. Always inform them if theyâ€™re actually being stopped/detained.

* A person is detained on a traffic stop when the officer has activated emergency signals behind them, and they have pulled to the side of the roadway and stopped. It is the law to yield right of way to emergency vehicles with signals activated and failure to yield is a crime.
