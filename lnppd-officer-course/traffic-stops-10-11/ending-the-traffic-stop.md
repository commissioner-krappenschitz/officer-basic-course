# Ending the Traffic Stop

* When your investigation is complete and the driver is no longer to be detained, ensure you return the appropriate documents to the driver
* Ask the driver if they have any questions for you, do not entertain banter or harassment- simply leave
* DO NOT be preachy with the driver
  * _“next time don’t do that”_ or _“Driver better”_ are phrases that should not be used
* Inform the driver that they are free to leave
* OBSERVE THE DRIVER LEAVE and if necessary, assist them with returning to the lane of traffic by blocking traffic for them

We watch the driver leave to ensure they don’t pull out into us and cause an accident or attempt to shoot us as we drive by. Let them leave first.
