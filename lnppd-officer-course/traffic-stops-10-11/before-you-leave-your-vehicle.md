# Before you leave your vehicle

* Ensure dispatch or the patrol knows where you are, what vehicle you have stopped, the license plate of the vehicle you have stopped and if possible the number of occupants inside the vehicle

{% hint style="info" %}
**Example with a dispatcher:**

_“(Callsign), Traffic”_&#x20;

Announcing <mark style="color:red;">**who**</mark> you are and your traffic stop so they have time to copy information



_“(Callsign), Traffic, Route 68 cross of Joshua Road, White Vapid Sadler, 1 occupant, 28 when ready.”_&#x20;

This tells the dispatcher <mark style="color:red;">**where**</mark> you are, <mark style="color:red;">**what**</mark> the make/model/color of the vehicle, the occupants, and that you have a plate. Allow time for the dispatcher to generate the call, and get ready to run the plate. When the dispatcher informs you they are ready for the plate-



_“(Callsign), 28, Zero-Five-Hotel-Alpha-Hotel-Four-Seven-Zero”_&#x20;

at this point it’s the officers choice whether to proceed with or without read back on the vehicle or person.

**Example without a dispatcher:**

_“<mark style="color:red;">**who**</mark> (callsign), Traffic Route 68 cross of Joshua Road, White Vapid Sadler, 1 occupant, 28, Zero-Five-Hotel-Alpha-Hotel-Four-Seven-Zero”._&#x20;

This tells the patrol <mark style="color:red;">**where**</mark> you are, <mark style="color:red;">**what**</mark> the make/model/color of the vehicle, the occupants, and relays the plate to the patrol. Understand this is in the event the vehicle needs to be identified at a later time or escapes and you need to build a case against the driver.

* At this point, if you are satisfied with your set up, make your approach

{% hint style="warning" %}
If for any reason you desire an additional officer, request one- you don’t have to go alone
