# Making Contact

After exiting your vehicle, you have the choice of making approach to the driver or passenger side of the vehicle

* Look into the vehicle on approach, don’t forget to use your senses (sight/smell) to detect substances or something awry, remember that every traffic stop is an investigation _(/me Do I smell/see anything in/from the vehicle?)_
* **BE AWARE OF DRIVER BEHAVIOR** - the drivers tone/appearance could tip you off to a situation developing before you, pay attention.
* Greet the driver, and introduce yourself as a law enforcement official and request identification. Saying the reason for the stop is not a legal requirement, nor is providing a supervisor.
* Request identification on the vehicle being operated (this is a legal requirement. It is an arrestable misdemeanor to fail to ID when requested lawfully.)
  * “Good evening, I’m officer (name) with the La Nueva Pilipinas Police Department. The reason I’m _stopping you this evening is for speeding on Joshua road, may I see your license?”_
* Retrieve the drivers license and proceed to a safe area to conduct your investigation
* DO NOT stand at the driver/passenger door of the suspect vehicle and run documents- this is for all intents and purposes a kill zone, and you want to spend as little time there as possible
* Return to your vehicle, and request Name/Plate search from dispatch or perform them yourself through the CAD interface

Note- you do not need to sit inside your vehicle while performing this, remember that your car is your coffin and it’s the most exposed place for you to be during this procedure. Instead try opening your passenger door or stand behind your vehicle away from the road. **ALWAYS PLAN FOR A GUNFIGHT** and have your next move planned in the case of engagement.
