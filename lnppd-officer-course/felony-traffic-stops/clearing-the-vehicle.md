# Clearing the Vehicle

* Leave an officer at the patrol vehicles, and ensure the owners lock their vehicles. Then approach the suspect vehicle as a team of at least 2 and clear it.
* <mark style="color:red;">**INVENTORY THE ENTIRE VEHICLE**</mark> and <mark style="color:red;">**LOG EVIDENCE**</mark> before you call tow
* Inform units via radio that the scene is clear after all subjects have been detained and the vehicle is cleared.
* Perform a <mark style="color:red;">**THOROUGH SEARCH**</mark> of all suspects and the suspect vehicle
* Understand that because someone is in a vehicle with a wanted felon, does not mean they need to be arrested and jailed. If you do not have a purpose to arrest a subject, do not take them to jail. Ensure you release them once the scene has been processed.
