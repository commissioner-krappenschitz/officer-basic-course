# Felony Stops

Often performed when stopping an individual who has previously fled from officers, performed a dangerous crime, or is suspected of having committed a violent crime- a High Risk / Felony takedown (code 5) stop is used to ensure maximum safety for officers by extracting individuals from the suspect vehicle one at a time- and then clearing the vehicle after approaching the vehicle

* This can be performed by as little as 2 officers, but should be performed by 3 or more if available

### Formation

* When performing a High Risk / Felony stop lead police vehicles will be used to form a V shape, leaving a 3 foot gap between the front bumpers and angled smartly by the officers to provide cover
* The V should be 2-3 car lengths away from the suspect vehicle and take down lights should be activated to keep the scene well lit during dark hours
* A third vehicle will be positioned centered behind the “V” if available
