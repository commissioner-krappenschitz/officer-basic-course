# Redirecting Traffic Flow

* If at all possible, traffic should be directed around the scene of the accident as deemed appropriate by the officers on scene.
* Officers should take initiative and ensure traffic flows around the scene of the accident, and reopen lanes of traffic as appropriate. If in doubt, ask the senior officer on scene.
* You do not need to block every lane of traffic at every scene and opening lanes of travel as soon as possible should be prioritized.
