# Scene Safety

* Officers are encouraged, especially during poor weather conditions or night time, to wear their reflective orange safety vest while on the scene of an accident to improve visibility
* Officers should assess injuries initially and relay information as appropriate to responding EMS and Fire units. Number of patients, and wounds sustained can help responding medical assets pre-plan for arrival.
* It IS NOT the responsibility of the officer to extract occupants from vehicles if conditions are safe for the occupants to remain in the vehicle. Undue extraction could cause further injury, and only necessary basic first aid/triage should be rendered.
