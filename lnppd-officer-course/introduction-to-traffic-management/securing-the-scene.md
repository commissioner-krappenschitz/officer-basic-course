# Securing the Scene

* Accident scenes, due to their nature, tend to be chaotic and confusing. Because of this, the officers first action on arrival needs to be with securing the scene properly and ensuring officer safety
* The primary officer should position their vehicle approximately 30 feet from the accident, and blocking the appropriate lane of traffic to ensure the flow of traffic will be diverted around the area they intend to work through
* The secondary officer should position their vehicle to block the next lane of traffic, if necessary, or smartly behind the first officers vehicle at a distance of 15-30 feet to establish a barrier between traffic and the officers on scene
* The purpose of blocking traffic serves not only to protect officers from other motorists, but to provide a working area for EMS and fire responding

* Note the angle of the vehicles- this ensures maximum protection for the officers and responding medical units involved in the scenario
* Always angle your vehicle to deflect traffic in the desired direction – do not deflect traffic into your own scene
* In some instances blocking a single lane of traffic is necessary, the other lane will be left open to allow traffic to flow
* In some instances it may require a full shutdown of traffic for hazmat, don’t hesitate to push the perimeter further back in this instance
* Ensure there is appropriate space for EMS/FIRE to perform their duties and build space as needed
