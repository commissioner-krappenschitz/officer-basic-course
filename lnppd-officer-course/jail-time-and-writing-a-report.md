# Jail Time & Writing a Report

* Take them into the jail, process their arrest and information and jail the individual for the appropriate time as listed in the penal code
  * Use the F6 menu/wheel under the LEO section and assign the appropriate time
* In the interest of continuity of roleplay, officers should tally the charges and arrest time- then send criminals to jail for that time.
  * 4000 seconds or greater of time accrued constitutes a “Life Sentence”
  * The maximum “assignable” jail time for civilians in server is 3600
  * _<mark style="color:red;">LEO do not need to open a ticket and request to assign a life sentence</mark>_
* Once the individual has been sent to jail for the time you tally-
  * Make sure the correct prison time and fine are assigned to their arrest report
  * Make sure the arrest notes are thorough and include a summary of the arrest, locations/ postal
  * The arrest notes can be as brief or as detailed as you would like- but you should include at least what you witnessed, evidence found, witnesses, and a summary of the events.

Arrest reports do not need to be as large as this but need to hold enough information to be able to read back and understand what happened in the future.
