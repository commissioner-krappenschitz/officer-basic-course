### Lethal Force Explained

Using Lethal weapons to gain control of a situation. This should only be used if a suspect poses a serious threat to the officer or another individual. The intent is to cause serious bodily injury or death.

* Peace Officers reserve the right to use lethal force options when any person presents immediate significant threat to law enforcement or the public, and in the officers own judgement, has both intent and ability to cause grievous harm.
* The unjust use of lethal force may result in lawsuits filed against the individual and department, arresting of the officer and removal from duty for an indefinite period of time while an investigation is conducted.
* You DO NOT need to request authorization to exercise Lethal Force. DO NOT request authorization to exercise Lethal Force from the dispatcher.
